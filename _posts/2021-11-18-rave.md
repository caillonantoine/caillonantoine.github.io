We are happy to announce that we release the code for our RAVE model ([see the article](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.05011)) !

[![rave_logo](https://github.com/caillonantoine/RAVE/raw/master/docs/rave.png)](https://github.com/caillonantoine/RAVE)

It includes RAVE, an autoregressive model to learn RAVE's prior, and scripts to train them on a custom dataset. Using RAVE you can perform timbre transfer, latent space exploration, conditional and unconditional generation !

We are also currently writing an article to make RAVE go real-time inside max-msp! Coming soon :)

Listen to some unconditional darbouka synthesis made in real-time using max/msp and RAVE ! (thanks [Maxime Mantovani](https://www.maximemantovani.com/) for the dataset ! )

### About the logo

I was walking around Paris and I came across a sign announcing work on a building, with a very nice _RAVE_ writing ! Could it be a coincidence ?
