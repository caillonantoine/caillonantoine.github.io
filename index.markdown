I'm currently a PhD student at [ircam](https://www.ircam.fr/), where I work on **Hierarchical temporal learning for multi-instrument and orchestral audio synthesis**, using many sorts of deep learning models from _GANs_ to _VAEs_, _normalizing flows_ and _diffusion models_. I am also a big fan of realtime implementation of such models, and have implemented several models as **PureData** and **Max/MSP** externals.

By the way, you can get my [CV for free here](cv).
