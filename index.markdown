I'm currently a Post-doc at [ircam](https://www.ircam.fr/), where I work on **Neural Audio Synthesis**, using many sorts of deep learning models from _GANs_ to _VAEs_, _transformers_, _normalizing flows_ and _diffusion models_. I am also a big fan of realtime implementation of such models, and have implemented several models as **PureData** and **Max/MSP** externals.

By the way, you can get my [CV for free here](cv).
