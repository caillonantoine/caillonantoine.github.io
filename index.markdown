I'm currently a PhD student at  [ircam](https://www.ircam.fr/), where I work on **Hierarchical temporal learning for multi-instrument and orchestral audio synthesis**, using many sorts of deep learning models from *GANs* to *VAEs*, *normalizing flows* and *diffusion models*. I am also a big fan of realtime implementation of such models, and have implemented several models as **PureData** externals (see [project section](/projects)).

By the way, you can get my [CV for free here](/assets/cv.pdf).
